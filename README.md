This Python script is primarily focused on parsing and extracting relevant log entries from log files based on specific timestamp patterns.

It offers a range of functions to identify and process various timestamp formats commonly found in log files. 

The script can search for patterns such as timestamps in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS," verbose logging timestamps, timestamps with various date formats, and AM/PM timestamps, among others.

The core logic of the script revolves around locating log entries that match a given timestamp or fall within a one-minute timeframe of a reference timestamp, typically associated with a failure event. The extracted log entries are then written to an output file. 

The script supports searching within individual log files and across multiple log files located in a specified directory.

Overall, this script serves as a useful tool for log analysis and debugging, allowing users to pinpoint and extract log entries related to specific events or issues based on timestamp patterns, facilitating more efficient troubleshooting and debugging processes.
